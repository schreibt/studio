# Rule for README Maintenance

When updating or modifying the React Components Assignment project:

- Always check if the README.md in trickle/notes needs to be updated
- Update component documentation when adding new props or features
- Update the file structure section when adding new files
- Update the features checklist when implementing new functionality
- Keep the usage examples current with the actual component implementations
- Update the tech stack section if new dependencies are added
- Maintain consistency between the README and actual component interfaces
